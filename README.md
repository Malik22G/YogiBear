## üõ† Game Architecture
This game uses the **Model-View-Controller (MVC)** pattern:

1. **Model:** Manages the game state (Yogi, Rangers, Obstacles, Baskets).
2. **View:** Graphical interface and rendering.
3. **Controller:** Processes user input, updates the model, and refreshes the view.

### Key Classes
1. **`Player` (Yogi Bear)**  
   - Moves around the board to collect baskets.  
   - Loses a life if colliding with a ranger.

2. **`Ranger`**  
   - Patrols horizontally or vertically, reducing Yogi‚Äôs lives on close contact.

3. **`GameController`**  
   - Handles user input, collision detection, and game state transitions (win/lose conditions).

4. **`GameFrame`**  
   - Main window hosting the game. Provides menus for **Restart** and **High-Scores**.

5. **`GamePanel`**  
   - Renders the actual game visuals.  
   - Displays game status (lives, baskets, etc.) in a status bar.

---

## ‚úÖ Features & Mechanics
- **Real-time Ranger AI Movement**
- **Collision Detection:** Yogi vs. rangers, baskets, and obstacles
- **Level Progression:** Automatic loading of new levels when baskets are fully collected
- **High-Score System:** Stores player names and scores
- **User-Friendly UI:** Simple menus, status bars, and input controls
- **Smooth Animations:** Updates at regular intervals

## ‚öôÔ∏è Important Methods
Below is a summary of significant methods in the code (adjust method names to your actual implementation):

1. **`GameFrame#createMenu()`**  
   - Initializes the menu bar with **Restart** and **High-Scores** items.

2. **`GamePanel#paintComponent(Graphics g)`**  
   - Draws game elements (Yogi, Rangers, Obstacles, Baskets).  
   - Calls `GameController#render(Graphics g)` for detailed object rendering.

3. **`GameController#keyPressed(KeyEvent e)`**  
   - Processes keyboard input to move Yogi.  
   - Triggers collision detection after movement.

4. **`GameController#checkCollisions()`**  
   - Checks Yogi‚Äôs distance to rangers (loses life if too close).  
   - Checks if Yogi collected any baskets.

5. **`GameController#loadNextLevel()`**  
   - Loads a new level once all baskets in the current level are collected.

6. **`GameController#endGame()`**  
   - Prompts the player to enter their name.  
   - Saves the high score if Yogi‚Äôs lives reach zero.

7. **`HighscoreManager#addScore(String playerName, int baskets, int levelsCleared)`**  
   - Stores a new high score in the database or file.

8. **`HighscoreManager#getAllScores()`**  
   - Retrieves high scores in a sorted list.
